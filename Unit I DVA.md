#### **Elements**

1. **Elements** are the individual items or subjects we collect data about.
    
2. Each **element** can be a person, object, event, or place.
    
3. In a data table, each row usually represents an **element**.
    
4. Examples include students in a class, products in a store, or countries in a survey.
    
5. We study **elements** to observe their characteristics or behaviors.

#### **Variables**

1. A **variable** is a property or characteristic of an element that can change.
    
2. It can be measured or recorded for each element.
    
3. Examples: age, height, weight, price, temperature.
    
4. Variables can be **quantitative** (numerical) or **qualitative** (categorical).
    
5. Each **variable** has a name (like "age") and values (like 21, 25, etc.).

### üîπ **Classification of Data**

#### 1. **Based on Nature**

- **Qualitative (Categorical) Data**:
    
    - Describes qualities or characteristics.
        
    - E.g., color, gender, type.
        
- **Quantitative (Numerical) Data**:
    
    - Represents numeric values.
        
    - E.g., age, height, marks.
        

#### 2. **Based on Measurement**

- **Nominal**: Labels only (e.g., blood group).
    
- **Ordinal**: Order matters but not the difference (e.g., ranks).
    
- **Interval**: Order + difference meaningful, no true zero (e.g., temperature).
    
- **Ratio**: Order + difference + true zero (e.g., weight, height).
    

#### 3. **Based on Source**

- **Primary Data**: Collected firsthand by the researcher.
    
- **Secondary Data**: Already collected and used from other sources.
    

#### 4. **Based on Time**

- **Cross-sectional Data**: Collected at a single point in time.
    
- **Time-series Data**: Collected over a period of time.

# Indexing and Data management ,sampling ,resampling (some parts are here)from notes

# Resampling
Here are **short notes** on **Cross-Validation** and **Bootstrapping** ‚Äì ideal for quick revision:

---

### ‚úÖ **Cross-Validation (CV) ‚Äì Short Notes**

- **Definition**: A resampling method used to **evaluate model performance** by splitting data into multiple parts (folds).
    
- **No replacement** ‚Äì each data point appears in test set only once per fold.
    
- **Types**:
    
    - **k-Fold CV**: Split data into _k_ parts; train on _k‚Äì1_, test on 1.
        
    - **Leave-One-Out CV (LOOCV)**: Use one sample as test, rest as train; repeat for all samples.
        
    - **Stratified k-Fold**: Maintains class balance in each fold (useful in classification).
        
    - **Repeated k-Fold**: k-Fold CV repeated multiple times with different splits.
        
- **Use**: Model evaluation, **hyperparameter tuning**, avoiding overfitting.

### üîÅ **Bootstrapping ‚Äì Short Notes**

- **Definition**: A resampling method where **samples are drawn with replacement** from the original dataset.
    
- **Each sample may contain duplicates**; some original points may be missing.
    
- **Used to estimate**:
    
    - Confidence intervals
        
    - Variance and bias of statistics
        
    - Model stability

üîπ Measures of Dispersion  
(Describe the spread or variability in the data)

**Range**

Difference between maximum and minimum values.  
Simple but affected by outliers.  
Formula: Range = Max - Min

**Variance**

Average of squared differences from the mean.  
Formula: Variance = (Œ£(x·µ¢ ‚àí xÃÑ)¬≤) / n

**Standard Deviation (SD)**

Square root of variance.  
Shows how much values deviate from the mean.  
Lower SD = data is close to the mean.  
Formula: SD = ‚àö[(Œ£(x·µ¢ ‚àí xÃÑ)¬≤) / n]

**Interquartile Range (IQR)**

Spread of the middle 50% of data.  
Formula: IQR = Q3 - Q1

**Mean Absolute Deviation (MAD)**

Average of absolute deviations from the mean.  
Less sensitive to outliers than variance.  
Formula: MAD = (Œ£|x·µ¢ ‚àí xÃÑ|) / n
