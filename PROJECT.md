Awesome — let’s break it down into **how "Plant Buddy" would actually work**, step-by-step. I’ll keep it beginner-friendly but useful enough to build out.

## 🌱 **"Plant Buddy" — How It Works**

### 🔁 Overall Flow:

1. User lands on your homepage
    
2. Searches for a plant using an input
    
3. You fetch results from the plant API (like Trefle)
    
4. User clicks a plant → you show detailed info (light, water, toxicity, etc.)
    
5. User can add it to “My Garden”
    
6. User gets reminders based on watering frequency (optional)
    
7. Data is saved locally or in Firebase

## 🧱 Pages/Components Breakdown

### 🏡 **1. Home Page**

- Search bar (`<SearchBar />`)
    
- Recent or popular plants preview (`<PlantCard />`)
    
- Links to “My Garden” and About
    

### 🔍 **2. Search Results Page**

- API call on search (e.g., `https://api.trefle.io/api/v1/plants/search?q=fern`)
    
- Show results as a grid of cards
    
- Each card links to a detailed view
    

### 🌿 **3. Plant Detail Page**

- Shows:
    
    - Common & scientific name
        
    - Watering needs
        
    - Sunlight level
        
    - Toxicity (optional)
        
    - Image
        
- Button: “Add to My Garden”
    

### 🪴 **4. My Garden Page**

- Shows all saved plants (from LocalStorage or DB)
    
- Option to mark as “Watered” or “Needs Attention”
    
- Optional: display a watering schedule

## 📦 API Usage (Trefle Example)

You'll use something like:

```js
const fetchPlants = async (query) => {
  const res = await fetch(`https://trefle.io/api/v1/plants/search?token=YOUR_TOKEN&q=${query}`);
  const data = await res.json();
  return data;
};
```

---

## 🧠 State Management

- You can use React Context or Zustand to store:
    
    - Current search results
        
    - "My Garden" plant list
        
    - Watering states
        

Or start simple with just `useState` + `localStorage`.

---

## 💾 Saving to My Garden

Use `localStorage`:

```js
const saveToGarden = (plant) => {
  const garden = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('garden')) || [];
  garden.push(plant);
  localStorage.setItem('garden', JSON.stringify(garden));
};
```

## 🛎️ Optional Extras

- Notifications with `react-toastify`
    
- Watering reminders using a simple date check
    
- Add offline mode (with service workers — advanced)
    

---

## 🔧 Tools You Might Use

- `create-react-app` or `Vite`
    
- `axios` or `fetch`
    
- `react-router-dom` for navigation
    
- `TailwindCSS` or styled-components
    
- `react-toastify` for alerts
    
- `date-fns` for handling watering dates
