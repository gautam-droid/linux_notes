### **Cloud Service Models**: service levels, user-managed vs provider-managed, SaaS, PaaS, IaaS

---

### **1. Software as a Service (SaaS)**

**Definition**: ready-to-use software over the internet, hosted & managed by provider

**Key Characteristics**

- No local installation
    
- Web access from any location
    
- Subscription/pay-as-you-go
    
- Automatic updates
    
- Multi-tenant architecture
    

**User Responsibility**: data, user settings  
**Provider Responsibility**: infrastructure, runtime, middleware, app, security

**Examples**

- Google Workspace (Gmail, Docs, Sheets)
    
- Microsoft Office 365
    
- Salesforce (CRM)
    
- Dropbox (cloud file storage)

**Key Characteristics**

- No infrastructure management
    
- Provides tools, frameworks, databases, middleware
    
- Supports multiple languages
    
- Fast development & deployment
    
- Auto-scaling
    

**User Responsibility**: application code, data  
**Provider Responsibility**: infrastructure, OS, runtime, middleware, security

**Examples**

- Google App Engine
    
- Microsoft Azure App Service
    
- Heroku
    
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### **3. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**

**Definition**: virtualized computing resources (VMs, storage, network) delivered over the internet

**Key Characteristics**

- Raw infrastructure access
    
- Full OS and software control
    
- On-demand scaling
    
- Pay-as-you-go
    
- User manages OS, middleware, runtime
    

**User Responsibility**: OS, applications, middleware, data, runtime  
**Provider Responsibility**: physical hardware, storage, networking, virtualization

**Examples**

- Amazon EC2
    
- Google Compute Engine
    
- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines
