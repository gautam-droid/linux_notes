### **Statistical Hypothesis Generation and Testing (in short points):**

1. **Hypothesis Generation**
    
    - It is the process of **formulating assumptions** about a population based on sample data.
        
    - Hypotheses are usually of two types: **Null (H‚ÇÄ)** and **Alternative (H‚ÇÅ)**.
        
        
2. **Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ)**
    
    - It states that **there is no effect or difference**.
        
    - Acts as a default statement to be tested and possibly rejected.
        
3. **Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ)**
    
    - It states that **there is an effect or difference**.
        
    - It is accepted if there is sufficient evidence to reject H‚ÇÄ.
        
4. **Testing the Hypothesis**
    
    - Use **statistical tests** like t-test, z-test, or chi-square test.
        
    -  compare it to a  **p-value**.
        
5. **Significance Level (Œ±)**
    
    - Commonly set at **0.05 (5%)**.
        
    - If p-value < Œ±, then **reject H‚ÇÄ**; otherwise, **fail to reject H‚ÇÄ**.
        
6. **Errors in Hypothesis Testing**
    
    - **Type I Error**: Rejecting H‚ÇÄ when it is true.
        
    - **Type II Error**: Failing to reject H‚ÇÄ when H‚ÇÅ is true.
