Here are the **SQL commands** you have learned so far:

### **Basic SQL Commands**

- `SELECT` → Used to retrieve data from a table
    
- `FROM` → Specifies the table to query
    
- `WHERE` → Filters results based on conditions
    
- `IN` → Checks if a value is in a list (`WHERE name IN ('France', 'Germany', 'Italy')`)
    
- `LIKE` → Pattern matching (`WHERE name LIKE 'United%'`)
    
- `NOT LIKE` → Excludes matching patterns (`WHERE name NOT LIKE '%a%'`)
    

### **Logical Operators**

- `AND` → Requires both conditions to be true (`WHERE area > 3000000 AND population > 250000000`)
    
- `OR` → Requires at least one condition to be true (`WHERE area > 3000000 OR population > 250000000`)
    
- `NOT` → Negates a condition (`WHERE name NOT LIKE '% %'`)
    
- `XOR (exclusive OR)` → Simulated using `OR` and `AND NOT` (`(A OR B) AND NOT (A AND B)`)
    

### **Functions & Operators**

- `LENGTH()` → Finds the length of a string (`WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital)`)
    
- `ROUND()` → Rounds numbers (`ROUND(gdp/population, -3)`)
    
- `*` → Multiplication (`SELECT area * 2 FROM world`)
    
- `/` → Division (`SELECT gdp / population FROM world`)
    

### **Comparison Operators**

- `=` → Equals (`WHERE population = 64000`)
    
- `!=` or `<>` → Not equal (`WHERE teamid != 'GER'`)
    
- `>` → Greater than (`WHERE area > 3000000`)
    
- `<` → Less than (`WHERE population < 5000000`)
    
- `>=` → Greater than or equal to (`WHERE gdp >= 1000000000000`)
    
- `<=` → Less than or equal to (`WHERE area <= 500000`)

These commands cover **filtering, pattern matching, logical conditions, arithmetic operations, and functions** in SQL.

Let me know if you need examples or explanations for any of them! 🚀

#NOTE

Got it! Here’s the simplest way to understand this:

Why AND works for exclusion (!=)

WHERE (subject != 'Chemistry' AND subject != 'Medicine')

✔ This works because:

It checks each row separately.

A row is included only if it is NOT Chemistry AND NOT Medicine.

A row can satisfy both conditions at the same time (e.g., Physics is neither Chemistry nor Medicine).



---

Why AND fails for selecting two different things(WE CAN'T SELECT BOTH AT THE SAME TIME, WE CAN ONLY SELECT EITHER OF THEM AT A TIME)

WHERE subject = 'Physics' AND subject = 'Chemistry'

❌ This fails because:

A single row cannot be both Physics and Chemistry at the same time.

No row will match, so you get zero results.


✅ Correct way? Use OR

WHERE subject = 'Physics' OR subject = 'Chemistry'

Now, a row can be either Physics or Chemistry, so both are included.



---

One Line Rule

✅ Use AND for things that must be true together in one row.
✅ Use OR when you want to select different groups of rows.

Hope this makes it super simple! Let me know if anything still feels unclear.

**Comprehensive List of SQL Doubts and Answers**

---

### 1. **JOINs & Filtering**

#### **How are rows paired in a JOIN?**

- In a JOIN, rows are paired based on a condition, usually a common column between two tables.
    
- Example:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT game.team1, game.team2, goal.player
    FROM game
    INNER JOIN goal ON game.id = goal.matchid;
    ```
    
    This pairs each row in `game` with matching rows in `goal` where `game.id = goal.matchid`.
    

#### **Do SQLBolt exercises only cover LEFT JOIN?**

- Yes, SQLBolt states that only LEFT JOIN is supported in its exercises.
    

#### **How can I practice all types of JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)?**

- Websites like SQLZoo, W3Schools, LeetCode, and Mode Analytics provide interactive exercises covering all JOIN types.
    

#### **WHERE clause filtering with `LIKE` (e.g., `player LIKE '%Mario'`)?**

- `LIKE '%Mario'` is incorrect.
    
- Use `LIKE 'Mario%'` for names starting with Mario and `LIKE '%Mario%'` for names containing Mario.
    

#### **Filtering records where Germany was an opponent team**

- Find non-German players who scored against Germany:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT player
    FROM game JOIN goal ON game.id=goal.matchid
    WHERE (team1='GER' OR team2='GER') AND teamid!='GER';
    ```
    

#### **Error: `relation "game" does not exist`**

- This error occurs if the table `game` does not exist in the database or is not properly referenced.
    
- Ensure the table is correctly named and exists in your schema.

### 2. **SQL Platforms & Syntax Differences**

#### **Difference between MySQL and PostgreSQL**

- PostgreSQL supports advanced features like `JSONB`, `CTEs`, and full-text search.
    
- MySQL is simpler and optimized for read-heavy applications.
    

#### **Are all SQL syntaxes the same across databases?**

- No. Each SQL dialect has variations in functions, indexing, and JOIN behavior.
    

#### **Which is better: SQLZoo or SQLBolt?**

- SQLZoo is better for hands-on practice with all JOINs and complex queries.
    
- SQLBolt is more structured for beginners.

### 3. **Basic SQL Queries & Operators**

#### **Understanding `SELECT name, area*2 FROM world WHERE population = 64000`**

- This query selects the name and twice the area of countries where `population = 64000`.
    

#### **Using `LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital)`**

- Finds countries where the name and capital have the same number of characters.
    
    ```sql
    SELECT name, capital FROM world
    WHERE LENGTH(name) = LENGTH(capital);
    ```
    

#### **Writing XOR conditions using AND/OR combinations**

- XOR means one condition is true, but not both.
    
    ```sql
    WHERE (area > 3000000 OR population > 250000000)
    AND NOT (area > 3000000 AND population > 250000000);
    ```
    

#### **Meaning of "since the year 2000" in SQL**

- It means selecting records from 2000 onwards:
    
    ```sql
    WHERE yr >= 2000
    ```
    

---

### 4. **BETWEEN & Inclusive Ranges**

#### **How to use `BETWEEN` and make it inclusive?**

- `BETWEEN` is inclusive by default.
    
    ```sql
    WHERE yr BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989;
    ```
    
    Includes both 1980 and 1989.
    

#### **Query to find Nobel Prize winners from 1980 to 1989 using `BETWEEN`**

```sql
SELECT yr, subject, winner
FROM nobel
WHERE subject='Literature' AND yr BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989;
```

---

### 5. **Sorting & Conditions**

#### **When to use `AND` vs. `OR`?**

- `AND` requires both conditions to be true.
    
- `OR` requires at least one condition to be true.
    

#### **Sorting by `ORDER BY` and how it works with strings**

- Strings are sorted alphabetically by default.
    
- Example:
    
    ```sql
    ORDER BY name ASC;
    ```
    

#### **Sorting special cases (putting `chemistry` and `physics` last)**

- Use `CASE WHEN`:
    
    ```sql
    ORDER BY
      CASE WHEN subject IN ('chemistry', 'physics') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END,
      subject, winner;
    ```
    

---

### 6. **CASE WHEN & SQL Functions**

#### **How does `CASE WHEN` work?**

- Used for conditional logic:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT name,
      CASE WHEN population > 1000000 THEN 'Large' ELSE 'Small' END AS Size
    FROM world;
    ```
    

#### **What does `END AS` mean?**

- It is used to alias the result of a `CASE WHEN` statement or an expression.
    

#### **Can `END AS` only be used in `SELECT`?**

- Yes, it is mainly used in `SELECT` statements to rename the output column.
    

---

### 7. **Errors & Fixes**

#### **`Unknown column 'name' in ORDER BY`**

- Ensure `name` exists in the selected columns.
    
- Example:
    
    ```sql
    SELECT name FROM world ORDER BY name;
    ```
    

#### **Fixing SQL syntax errors (`LIKE` usage, incorrect column references)**

- `LIKE` must be used correctly:
    
    ```sql
    WHERE name NOT LIKE '%a%' AND name NOT LIKE '%e%'
          AND name NOT LIKE '%i%' AND name NOT LIKE '%o%'
          AND name NOT LIKE '%u%'
    ```
