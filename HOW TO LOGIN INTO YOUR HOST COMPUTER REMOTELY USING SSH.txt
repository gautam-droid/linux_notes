Step1:
install dropbear, openssh server for self hosting your linux distro
and openssh client (must)
as openssh server is giving problem in ubuntu go with the lightweight dropbear
Step2:
run the command : "sudo systemctl status dropbear" , if you are using dropbear to check the status 
run the command : "sudo systemctl status ssh" , if you are using openssh server to check the status 
Step3:
If status shows , inactive then start the server using the following command
run the command : "sudo systemctl start dropbear" , if you are using dropbear to start the server and replace "start" with "stop" to stop it 
Step4:
Open a new terminal or the previous terminal or putty or termux or any other  terminal to connect to the host computer
Step5:
run the command: "sudo ssh username@ip", you will asked a password for running the sudo command and one more password to log into the server.
Step6:
To get the ip run the command "ifconfig" and search for "inet",the digits followed by the colon is user ip.And to get the username , 
run the command "whoami"
Step7:Now connect to the server using the command given in step5 replacing it with the host's username and ip and then enter the password.
